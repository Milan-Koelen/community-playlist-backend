## About The Project

There are some gread ways to collecd music and playlist. However switchint throught your differend soucrec is always a struggle when you just want to chill. This NodeJS backend helps you collect your favorite tracks into one folder. from both SoundCloud and Youtube.

Here's how:

- Send a post request throught the frontend (or to the endpoint).
- The server distinquishes beteween Youtube and SoundCloud tracks.
- According to what source the backend will use a different downloader to get the track and add it to the designated MP3 folder.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
